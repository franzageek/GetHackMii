## Introduction
GetHackMii is a script written in Batch that lets you to **automatically download** the latest version of the **HackMii Installer** (the installer for some homebrew software for Wii modding) and, once the program downloaded the HMI (HackMii Installer), GHM (GetHackMii) will **move the HMI folder into your SD Card/USB Drive** containing **homebrew apps**. In this way you can **make it appear in The Homebrew Channel**, being able to access it **more easily** (as easy as another homebrew app). 
You can now **stop using Letterbomb exploit** to access to the HMI, but you can now do so **like you would for an app: through HBC** (Homebrew Channel).

## Use
Using GHM is really simple.
First, you need to **download** the [`gethackmii.zip`](https://github.com/franzageek/GetHackMii/releases/download/v0.1.2-beta/gethackmii_v0.1.2.zip) folder (you can download other versions [here](https://github.com/franzageek/GetHackMii/releases/)). Once you downloaded it, extract it wherever you want (Desktop, Downloads are recommended).
Then, open the directory you extracted, and **run `gethackmii.bat` *normally***. 
**Warning: *do not run it as administrator: the program may mess up the System32 folder.***
When you start GHM, a window will open. There is an ***"About"* section** which explains what GHM will do. To begin with the download process, **press *1***.
**Insert your drive** containing **HB apps** (homebrew apps) and **press *Enter***.
Then, the process will start. First of all, GHM will **check all drives until it finds one with the** *`\apps\`* **folder**: the folder **created by HBC to contain HB apps.**
After finding the drives with the HB apps, GHM will **download the HMI folder from our repository** (*`hackmii_installer.zip`*) and **move it on the** *`drive\apps\`* **folder.**
Then, GHM will **clean up the environment** and **end the process**.
