## Introduction
GetHackMii is a script written in Batch that lets you to automatically download the latest version of the HackMii Installer (the installer for some homebrew software for Wii modding) and, once the program downloaded the HMI (HackMii Installer), GHM (GetHackMii) will move the HMI folder into your SD Card/USB Drive containing homebrew apps. In this way you can make it appear in The Homebrew Channel, being able to access it more easily (as easy as another homebrew app). 
You can now stop using Letterbomb exploit to access to the HMI, but you can now do so like you would for an app: through HBC (Homebrew Channel).

## Use
Using GHM is really simple.
First, you need to download the [`gethackmii.zip`](https://github.com/franzageek/GetHackMii/releases/download/v0.1.2-beta/gethackmii_v0.1.2.zip) folder (you can browse versions [here](https://github.com/franzageek/GetHackMii/releases/)
